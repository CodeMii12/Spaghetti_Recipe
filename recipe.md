Steps

Use a large pot.
Fill up the pot about halfway with water.
You can salt the water(only if you want to though).
Bring the water to a full, rolling boil. 
Stir to keep the pasta from sticking. 
Test the pasta two minutes before it's "ready"
Drain the water, mix with sauce and cooked hamburger meat, then serve hot.
